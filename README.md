# Dolphyn

This repository contains the software (Python package) and analysis scripts described in:

- Liebhoff, AM. et al. **Efficient antibody profiling of the human gut phageome with Dolphyn**. *In Submission* (2023).

The `Manuscript Analyses` folder contains the collection of scripts run for obtaining the plots in the figures. 
The `data` folder contains the collection of data used in the publication (except the Public Epitope Dataset, which is too large for a GitHub upload. Watch out for updates where to find it).
The `dolphyn` folder contains the Python package.

An example script for using the package is given in the `Dolphyn_library_design` Jupyter notebook.
